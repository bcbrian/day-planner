## Installation 
If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

## Usage 
The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and javascript. It could be used to create a quiz.

## Credits 
I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. In addition, several portions of code were created based on in class activities. I have included citations in the form of comments throughout the html and javascript.

## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project, but of course I had help from my instructor, TA's, and classmates.

## Challenges
I struggled with deciding when to create a function and when not to create a function. In addition, I struggled with deciding what to include in which function to make it as easy as possible to change code or read code in the future. Often made the mistake of defining a variable when really I wanted to set the value of the variable to a different value. Another major challenge was keeping all the element creation and appending of the elements straight. Sometimes got lost of what was being appended to which portion of the html.
